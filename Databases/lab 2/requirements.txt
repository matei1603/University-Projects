For the database created for the first lab, write SQL statements that ♦ insert data – for at least 4 tables; 

♦ update data – for at least 1 table; 

♦ delete date – for at least 1 table. 

In the UPDATE / DELETE statements, use at least once (in the WHERE clause):  the relational operators {<, <=, >, >=, =, <>}, the logical operators {AND, OR,  NOT}, {IS NULL, IS NOT NULL}, {IN, BETWEEN}, {LIKE, NOT LIKE}. At  least one operator from each category (mention above) should be used.  

On the same database, write the following SELECT queries: 

a. 3 queries with UNION, INTERSECT, EXCEPT (one query per operator); b. 4 queries with INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL JOIN (one  query per operator); one query will join at least 3 tables; 

c. 2 queries using IN and EXISTS to introduce a subquery in the WHERE  clause (one query per operator); 

d. 1 query with a subquery in the FROM clause; 

e. 3 queries with the GROUP BY clause, from which 2 queries will also  contain the HAVING clause; 1 query from the latter 2 will also have a  subquery in the HAVING clause; use the aggregation operators: SUM,  AVG, MIN, MAX, COUNT. 

In the SELECT queries mentioned above, you must use: 

♦ At least one composed condition with AND, OR, NOT in the WHERE  clause, for 2 queries; 

♦ DISTINCT in at least 1 query; TOP in at least 1 query; 

♦ ORDER BY in at least 2 queries.
